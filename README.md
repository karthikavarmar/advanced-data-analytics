This is a consulting case problem that leverages data analytics to derive a solution.

PowerCo. is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME and residential customers. Europe is facing a significant churn problem due to the power-liberalization of the energy market.  Problem is largest in the SME segment.We need to develop a predictive model to predict customer churn.


Hypothesis - 

that the churn is driven by the customer price sensitivity.
Some possibilities:
1.Churn-probable customers by 70% or above chances could be given a discount.
2. All the discounted consumers would need to agree and accept it.
Giving them 20% discount doesnâ€™t seem to be a completely good solution as they can incur losses.

There are other variables that comes into account like:
1.	The electricity consumption during the 1st period.
2.	The price of the power for the coming months.
3.	Predicted meter reading bill for the next period. 

Best Options to follow:
1. Analyse the trend by Marketing statistics.
2. Offer discounts for the churn-probable customers.
3. Build trust and loyalty with the customers.
4. Leave out the non-profitable and churnable customers.
